# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

This repository is dedicated to exploring **Time Series Analysis** and **Forecasting**, key areas of machine learning and statistical modeling that deal with analyzing and predicting time-dependent data. It provides a practical foundation for understanding, implementing, and experimenting with time series models and forecasting techniques.

## Overview

Time Series Analysis focuses on data with a time component, analyzing patterns such as trends, seasonality, and irregularities. Forecasting uses these patterns to predict future outcomes, enabling applications in various fields like finance, healthcare, and retail.

This repository includes:

- Techniques for decomposing time series into components: trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- Stationarity concepts and smoothing methods to prepare data for modeling.
- Implementations of autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), ARIMA, SARIMA, and other models.
- Applications of Survival Analysis for censored and event-based data.
- Practical examples and coding best practices for working with real-world datasets.

## Key Topics

### Time Series Analysis
- **Decomposition**: Understanding components such as trend and seasonality.
- **Stationarity**: Identifying and addressing non-stationarity in data.
- **Smoothing**: Techniques to reduce noise and improve model accuracy.

### Forecasting Models
- **Autoregressive Models (AR)**: Using past values for predictions.
- **Moving Average Models (MA)**: Leveraging residual errors for accuracy.
- **ARIMA and SARIMA**: Advanced models for non-stationary and seasonal data.

### Survival Analysis
- **Hazard Functions**: Modeling the time until an event occurs.
- **Censoring**: Analyzing incomplete or partially observed data.
